SpaceXs Super Heavy booster and Starship rocket exploded during a test flight on Tuesday, the third consecutive setback for Elon Musk's company.

Tuesday's uncrewed mission was the ninth test flight. The system suffered minor explosions in January and March. Together, the Starship rocket and Super Heavy booster are around 400 feet tall when stacked for a launch.

SpaceX has been developing the Starship system to transport people and equipment around Earth, and to the Moon. Musk also wants SpaceX to use Starship to colonize Mars.

A livestream of Tuesday's test flight, which ran on the SpaceX website and on social media, showed the first-stage booster exploding and the second-stage Starship spacecraft undergoing a major fuel leak, then spinning out of control and blowing up during reentry.
